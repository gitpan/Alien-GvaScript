Alien-GvaScript
===============
Geneva extension to the prototype javascript framework

This distribution contains three core components :

  * protoExtensions> : some extensions to the prototype javascript 
    framework (mainly walking the DOM searching for collections of 
    classnames).

  * event : registering and firing application-specific events 
    (in addition to the standard W3C event model)

  * keyMap : managing maps of handlers for key events (similar
    in spirit to Emacs keymaps)

and three widgets:

  * choiceList : dropdown list of choices with navigation 

  * autoCompleter : autocompletion on form input fields

  * treeNavigator : navigation in a tree structure, opening and 
    closing nodes
